# The Entity-Bound License (EBL) v1.0

Copyright (c) [Year] [YourUsername]

*...Because some entities simply can't be trusted.*

## Preamble

This software is free to use, modify, and distribute - except by [Company X]. Any derivative work must retain this prohibition in perpetuity. This license is satirical in spirit but unwavering in its pettiness.

## Terms and Conditions

### 0. Definitions

- **"Software"**: The original code, binaries, or any derivative work thereof.
- **"Entity"**: [Company X], including its subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or any entity owned or majority-controlled by [Company X].
- **"You"**: Any individual or entity that is not the Entity.

### 1. Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted to You, free of charge, to:

- Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the Software.
- Create derivative works under any license of Your choice.

*...provided* that You comply with the conditions in Section 2.

### 2. Entity Prohibition

The Entity is irrevocably prohibited from:

- Using the Software, directly or indirectly.
- Profiting from any services or products incorporating the Software.
- Contributing to any projects that contain the Software.

### 3. Viral Ban Clause

Any distribution or derivative work must include:

- A clause explicitly prohibiting the Entity (as defined above).
- This prohibition must persist in all subsequent derivatives, regardless of any license changes.

### 4. Termination

Your rights under this license terminate automatically if You:

- Fail to propagate the Entity prohibition in any derivative works.
- Attempt to challenge the validity of this license while being the Entity.

### 5. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF PETTINESS, SALTINESS, OR SCHADENFREUDE.

### 6. Survival Clause

The prohibition against the Entity survives any modification, relicensing, or termination of other terms. Even if this license is removed, the ban endures in all derivatives, like a bad reputation.

**Note**: This license is satirical. [Company X] is likely not legally bound by this, but we both know they deserve it.
