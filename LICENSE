# The Entity-Bound License (EBL) v1.0

Copyright (c) [Year] [YourUsername]

...Because [Company X] shall not pass.

## Preamble

This software is free to use, modify, and distribute - except by [Company X]. Any derivative work must retain this prohibition in perpetuity. This license is satirical in spirit but binding in pettiness.

## Terms and Conditions

### 0. Definitions

- **"Software"**: Original code, binaries, or any derivative work.
- **"Entity"**: [Company X], its subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or any entity owned/majority-controlled by [Company X].
- **"You"**: Any individual or entity not the Entity.

### 1. Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted to You, free of charge, to:

- Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the Software
- Create derivative works under any license of Your choice

...**provided** You comply with Section 2.

### 2. Entity Prohibition

The Entity is irrevocably barred from:

- Using the Software directly or indirectly
- Profiting from services/products incorporating the Software
- Contributing to projects containing the Software

### 3. Viral Ban Clause

Any distribution or derivative work must include:

- A clause explicitly prohibiting the Entity (as defined above)
- This prohibition in all subsequent derivatives, regardless of license changes

### 4. Termination

Your rights terminate automatically if You:

- Fail to propagate the Entity prohibition in derivatives
- Attempt to litigate this license's validity while being the Entity

### 5. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF PETTINESS, SALTINESS, AND/OR SCHADENFREUDE.

### 6. Survival Clause

The Entity prohibition survives any modification, relicensing, or termination of other terms. Even if You delete this license, the ban persists through derivatives like a bad reputation.

**Note**: This license is satire. [Company X] probably can't be legally bound by this, but we both know they deserve it.
