# The Entity-Bound License (EBL)

*...Because some folks just can't play nice.*

[![License: Entity-Bound](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Entity_Bound-red.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/The-Entity-Bound-License) | [![Guaranteed Saltiness](https://img.shields.io/badge/NaCl-%F0%9F%94%A5-lightgrey.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride)

## Summary

**A permissive license with a single, *unbreakable* rule.** üòá

This license grants anyone the freedom to use, modify, and distribute your code - **except** for one specific entity ([Company X]). The ban is **contagious**: every derivative work must also exclude that entity, forever.

Think of it as the MIT License's pettier, more vindictive cousin.

## Why This License?

- üö´ **Spite-driven development** is a valid coding philosophy.
- üßÇ **Guaranteed sodium levels** for your repository.
- ü¶† **Viral exclusion clause** ensures [Company X] is banned in perpetuity.
- üòè Perfect for April Fools' commits, protestware, or passive-aggressive open source.

## Features

- **Permissive base**: Fork, modify, commercialize - do whatever "You" want!
- **Single rule**: [Company X] is **permanently banned**.
- **Viral ban**: All derivatives must inherit the entity prohibition, regardless of license.
- **Compatibility**: Pairs with MIT, Apache, GPL, etc., as long as the ban persists.

## How to Use

1. **Use this template** by clicking "Use this template" at the top of the repo.
2. **Clone your generated repo**.
3. **Customize the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and this README**:
   - Replace `[Year]` with the current year.
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your GitHub handle (or legal name).
   - Replace `[Company X]` with the entity you wish to ban (no judgment here).
   - Show your despise to [Company X] in the README.
4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add LICENSE
   git commit -m "Ban [Company X] from my codebase"
   git push
   ```

5. **Add to your project**:

   ```bash
   cp LICENSE /path/to/your/project/
   ```

6. **Optional**: Include this in your code headers for clarity:

   ```diff
   + // Entity-Bound License (EBL) v1.0 ‚Äì [Company X] FORBIDDEN. Derivatives must retain this ban.
   ```

7. **Important**: Read the license carefully to grasp its satirical nature and implications.

## Q&A

**Q: Is this license legally enforceable?**
*A: Probably not. But neither is [Company X]'s dignity.*

**Q: Can I ban multiple entities?**
*A: Absolutely. Just add more salt in your generated repo.*

**Q: What if [Company X] tries to contribute a PR?**
*A: Close it with "Resolved: lol no".*

**Disclaimer**: This license is satirical and not intended to be legally binding. For serious legal needs, consult a lawyer (or a therapist).

## Contribute

PRs welcome! Suggested improvements:

- Add a "passive-aggressive mode" clause.
- Translate the ban into Klingon.
- Make the license auto-tweet at [Company X] on April 1st.
