# The Entity-Bound License (EBL)

*...Because some folks can't play nice.*

[![License: Entity-Bound](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Entity_Bound-red.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/The-Entity-Bound-License) | [![Guaranteed Saltiness](https://img.shields.io/badge/NaCl-%F0%9F%94%A5-lightgrey.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride)

## Summary

**It's just a permissive license... with a *tiny* extra rule!** 😇

This license lets anyone use, modify, and distribute your code **except** for *one specific entity* ([Company X]). Better yet – **the ban is contagious**. Every derivative work, forever, must also exclude the same entity.

Think of it as MIT's petty cousin.

## Why This License?

- 🚫 **Spite-driven development** is valid.
- 🧂 **Guaranteed sodium levels** for your repo.
- 🦠 **Viral clause** ensures eternal exclusion of [Company X].
- 😏 Perfect for April Fools' commits, protestware, or passive-aggressive open source.

## Features

- **Permissive base**: Fork, modify, commercialize – do whatever!
- **Single rule**: [Company X] is **banned forever**.
- **Viral ban**: Derivatives *must* inherit the entity prohibition (even if they change licenses).
- **Compatibility**: Works with MIT, Apache, GPL... as long as the ban stays.

## How to Use

1. **Replace placeholders** in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE):
   - `[YourUsername]` → Your GitHub handle (or mortal name).
   - `[Company X]` → Your least favorite entity (we won't judge).
2. **Add to your project**:

   ```bash
   # For maximum petty compliance
   cp LICENSE /path/to/your/project/
   ```

3. **Optional**: Add this to your code headers:

   ```diff
   + // Entity-Bound License (EBL) v1.0 – [Company X] FORBIDDEN. Derivatives must retain this ban.
   ```

## Installation (For Legal Chaos)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRO-2684/The-Entity-Bound-License.git
cd The-Entity-Bound-License
npm install sarcasm  # optional dependency
```

## Q&A

**Q: Is this legally enforceable?**
*A: Almost certainly not. But neither is [Company X]'s dignity.*

**Q: Can I ban multiple entities?**
*A: Fork the repo and add more salt.*

**Q: What if [Company X] tries to contribute a PR?**
*A: Close it with "Resolved: lol no".*

## Contribute

PRs welcome! Suggested improvements:

- Add a "passive-aggressive mode" clause.
- Translate the ban into Klingon.
- Make the license auto-tweet at [Company X] on April 1st.

**Disclaimer**: This license is satire. For actual legal needs, consult a lawyer (or a therapist).
