# The Entity-Bound License (EBL)

*...Because some folks just can't play nice.*

[![License: Entity-Bound](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Entity_Bound-red.svg)](https://github.com/PRO-2684/The-Entity-Bound-License) | [![Guaranteed Saltiness](https://img.shields.io/badge/NaCl-%F0%9F%94%A5-lightgrey.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride)

## Summary

**A permissive license with a single, *unbreakable* rule.** 😇

This license grants anyone the freedom to use, modify, and distribute your code - **except** for one specific entity ([Company X]). The ban is **contagious**: every derivative work must also exclude that entity, forever.

Think of it as the MIT License's pettier, more vindictive cousin.

## Why This License?

- 🚫 **Spite-driven development** is a valid coding philosophy.
- 🧂 **Guaranteed sodium levels** for your repository.
- 🦠 **Viral exclusion clause** ensures [Company X] is banned in perpetuity.
- 😏 Perfect for April Fools' commits, protestware, or passive-aggressive open source.

## Features

- **Permissive base**: Fork, modify, commercialize - do whatever "You" want!
- **Single rule**: [Company X] is **permanently banned**.
- **Viral ban**: All derivatives must inherit the entity prohibition, regardless of license.
- **Compatibility**: Pairs with MIT, Apache, GPL, etc., as long as the ban persists.

## How to Use

Choose your flavor of pettiness: a quick-and-dirty approach or a full-on spiteful setup. Both methods ban [Company X] with style.

### Simple Copy & Modify for One-Time Use

For when you just want [Company X] gone, no fuss.

1. **Download and copy the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file** from this repo to your project:

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/downloaded/LICENSE /path/to/your/project/
   ```

2. **Customize the placeholders** in the `LICENSE` file:
   - Replace `[Year]` with the current year (e.g., 2025).
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your GitHub handle or legal name.
   - Replace `[Company X]` with the entity you're banning (go wild, no judgment).
3. **Optional**: Add this header to your code files for extra clarity:

   ```diff
   + // Entity-Bound License (EBL) v1.0 – [Company X] FORBIDDEN. Derivatives must retain this ban.
   ```

4. **Done**: You've now cursed [Company X] out of your codebase. Enjoy the salt!

### Generate a Reusable License for Future Repos

For a reusable, spiteful EBL license instance.

1. **Use this template** by clicking "Use this template" at the top of the repo. Name your new repo like `yourusername's EBL`.
2. **Clone your generated repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername-s-EBL.git
   ```

3. **Customize the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and this README**:
   - Replace `[Year]` with the current year.
   - Replace `[YourUsername]` with your GitHub handle (or legal name).
   - Replace `[Company X]` with the entity you wish to ban (we won't tell).
   - Replace this README with a personal jab at [Company X] for extra spite.
4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add LICENSE README.md
   git commit -m "Ban [Company X] from my repos"
   git push
   ```

5. **Done**: You've now created a reusable, spiteful EBL license, ready to curse [Company X] in any repo.

**Important**: Whichever method you pick, read the license to savor its satirical bite.

## Q&A

- **Q: Is this license legally enforceable?**
- A: Probably not. But neither is [Company X]'s dignity.
- **Q: Can I ban multiple entities?**
- A: Absolutely. Just add more salt in your generated repo.
- **Q: What if [Company X] tries to open an issue or contribute a PR?**
- A: Close it with `Resolved: lol no`.

**Disclaimer**: This license is satirical and not intended to be legally binding. [Company X] is likely not legally bound by this, but we both know they deserve it. For serious legal needs, consult a lawyer (or a therapist).

## Contribute

PRs welcome! Suggested improvements:

- Add a "passive-aggressive mode" clause.
- Translate the ban into Klingon.
- Make the license auto-tweet at [Company X] on April 1st.
